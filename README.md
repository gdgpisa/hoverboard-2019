### Setup
:book: [Full documentation](/docs/).

Install Node.JS dependencies with:
```
npm install
```

Then start the development server with
```
npm run serve
```

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:3000` and provides basic URL routing for the app:

:book: Read more in [setup docs](/docs/tutorials/set-up.md).

### Build

This command performs HTML, CSS, and JS minification on the application
dependencies, and generates a service-worker.js file with code to pre-cache the
dependencies based on the entrypoint and fragments specified in `polymer.json`.
The minified files are output to the `build`.

```
npm run build
```

:book: Read more in [deploy docs](/docs/tutorials/deploy.md).
