Hi everyone,

We crafted our DevFest to be an occasion for everyone to speak and to **share a story**. We reserved a special place in the agenda to talk about *Diversity & Inclusion*, *Soft Skills* and whatever is not *techy*.

Today we're happy to share our **Soft track** a series of soft talks, that will take place on the morning of April 13th in the Room **PS4**. You will find the sessions marked in **blue** in the [schedule](/schedule).

We want to say a huge **thanks** to the speakers that submitted soft talks to our CFP and made the soft track possible:
