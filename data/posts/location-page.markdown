The conference will take place at the **University of Pisa** in the **Polo Fibonacci - Building E**. Pisa is a small town and you can easily walk around or rely on public transportation if you're coming from far away.


## By train 🚄
Pisa's railway station (Pisa Centrale) is directly connected with Turin, Rome, Genova and Milan. There are frequent connections with the Florence main station (Firenze Santa Maria Novella) that you can reach with an high-speed train (Freccia Rossa). 

[The train schedule is available at the site of Trenitalia.](http://www.trenitalia.com)

Recall that in Italy, before getting on the train, you must stamp your ticket by using those small yellow machines available within the station. 
To reach the venue, you can take the city bus number 4 and get off at the bus stop in via Buonarroti (stop called Buonarroti 1).

[Here you can find the directions on Google maps](https://goo.gl/maps/i8kgqhRBj752). 

As an alternative, the Department is at walking distance from the railway station (approximately 20-30 minutes).


## By car 🚗
Pisa is near the intersection of two highways: A12 north-south (Genova - Rosignano) and A11 east-west (Pisa - Florence). 

Please note that Pisa is a small town with several pedestrian areas (with access control cameras). Parking is a bit of a problem and most parking areas are with pay-meters. 

The nearest free parking to the venue is the [Park Pratale](https://goo.gl/maps/1xpJnXVLowJ2) (15 minutes walk) or the [Park Pietrasantina](https://goo.gl/maps/Cbi9aZy5qi92) (30 minutes walk).

## By plane ✈️
Pisa has an international airport with daily flights to London and Munich, as well as to Rome, Milan, and other important Italian cities. 

[The timetable of incoming and outgoing flights is available at the site of Pisa airport.](http://www.pisa-airport.com/it/i-passeggeri/arrivi/orario-generale.html)

The airport is approximately 3 km from the center. The most convenient way to reach the center is probably by taxi. Taxis are located near the "Arrivals" exit of the air terminal. If there is no taxi out there, you may call the [non-stop radio taxi service](http://www.cotapi.it/en/) by dialing 050 541600. 

As an alternative you can take the [Pisa Mover](http://pisa-mover.com/en/), a city train that connects Pisa Airport to Pisa Railway Station (Pisa Centrale), then take the city bus **number 4** and get off at the bus stop in via F. Buonarroti.
