Hi everyone,

We're happy to share that at DevFest Pisa we will celebrate the **IWD** (International Woman Day), recurring every year on the 8th of March 👩‍💻 We decided to celebrate this event having a space to talk about *Diversity & Inclusion*, *Soft Skills* and whatever is not *techy* (as we already have enough talks about technology 😅).

Today we're happy to share our **Soft track** a series of soft talks, that will take place on the morning of April 13th in the Room **PS4**. You will find the sessions marked in **blue** in the [schedule](/schedule).

We want to say a huge **thanks** to the speakers that submitted soft talks to our CFP and made the soft track possible:
