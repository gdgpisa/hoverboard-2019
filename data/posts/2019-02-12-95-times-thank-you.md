Hi everyone,

Exactly one week ago we closed our Call for Paper. Since then, our organizer team worked really hard to define the DevFest Pisa **Agenda**! We're happy to share that we're nearly done, and we'll be announcing the **first speakers** really soon.

If you're a speaker, please **check your inbox** as you might already received a feedback. If not, you'll get a feedback in the upcoming days.

Today we're happy to share some pretty interesting **statistics** from our Call for Paper.

First, we'd love to thank everyone who applied for spending time and preparing high-quality abstracts for our CFP. This year we received **95** proposals ðŸ˜± (compared to 43 from last year's DevFest). Choosing which talks to accept was really a challenge given the general quality of them.

In this graph you can see the trend of the CFP submission:

You can clearly see how the procrastinators waited until the last minute before submitting their proposals. ðŸ˜‚

Most of the proposals comes from Italy and Eu. But we're happy to share that we received some proposals from all around the globe! ðŸŒŽ Here you can find a map of the countries where the proposals came from:

Talking about the content, **Android** is confirmed again as the #1 topic in the proposals:

We also received quite a few proposals on the Web/Cloud side. A significant amount of Flutter proposals was also worth noting and several interesting talks on **Diversity and Inclusion**. 

Here's an heatmap of all the words in the submitted abstracts::
