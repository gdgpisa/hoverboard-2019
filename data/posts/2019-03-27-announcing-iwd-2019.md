Together we **celebrate** every single Woman's achievement.🍾  
## We imagine new **possibilities** looking at them from a different perspective and building them [together](https://medium.com/@kiaruzza_dev/t%C3%A8-dolcetti-e-tecnologia-8cb701349454).    
# We listen and we're **listened** to.  
## We receive **support** and give support to other people.  
# We encourage **diversity**.  
## We value **weaknesses**.  
# We show our **true essence**.  
## We do a **job** that we **like**.  
# We **feel safe** and **no one judges us**.  
## We [**choose**](https://gdgpisa.it/wtm).  

<br/>

Those points don't stand true for all of us.  
**Let's work [together](https://gdgpisa.it/wtm) to conquer them all**!
