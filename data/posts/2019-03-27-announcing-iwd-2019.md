Together we celebrate every single Woman's achievement.
We imagine new possibilities looking at them from a different perspective and building them [together](https://medium.com/@kiaruzza_dev/t%C3%A8-dolcetti-e-tecnologia-8cb701349454).
We listen and we're listened to.
We receive support and give support to other people.
We encourage diversity.
We value weaknesses.
We show our true essence.
We do a job that we like.
We feel safe and no one judges us.
We choose. (https://gdgpisa.it/wtm)

Those points do not stand true for all of us. 
Let's work together to conquer them all!
