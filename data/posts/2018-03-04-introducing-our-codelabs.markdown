Have you checked our [final agenda](/schedule)? You probably noticed that we added **two codelabs!** 🛠 to our schedule:

*  [The Kotlin codelab](http://devfest.gdgpisa.it/schedule/day1?sessionId=161)
*  [The Javascript codelab](http://devfest.gdgpisa.it/schedule/day1?sessionId=165)

Our DevFest is not only talks and tech sessions, we want to give you the chance to **learn by doing**! We organized those codelabs as longer sessions (1h30m), and with a **restricted number of participants**. You will be helped by a **tech expert** that will guide you during the codelab with **code examples** and **exercises**.

To participate to those codelabs you will need to have **your own laptop** 💻. Please be also sure to be **battery independent**, we can't guarantee enough powerlets for all the participants.

Due to the limited number of sposts, you need an **extra registration** for those codelabs. Please note that you need to have **also the DevFest ticket** to participate to those codelabs.

You can find the tickets to codelabs on eventbrite:
