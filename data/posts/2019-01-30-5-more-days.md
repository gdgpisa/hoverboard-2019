Hi everyone,

We're happy to announce that we received really **a lot of proposals** for our DevFest Pisa 2019.

**5 more days!** 

The final dealine for the cfp will be **February the 5th**, at 23.59 CET.
Time is running out!

* An opportunity to meet people with the same interests as you transmit knowledge to others
* A big family ðŸ¤—
