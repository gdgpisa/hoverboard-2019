**It's true!** ðŸŽ‰

We're happy to announce that DevFest Pisa will take place on **April 13th 2019**, in the _Aula Magna_ of Polo Fibonacci! 

2018 it's been an amazing year for both GDG and WTM Pisa. We organized several events during the year, delivering talks about Kotlin, Javascript, Golang and more technologies involving **over 700 participants**. In March we organized the first DevFest Pisa, a day full of talks and workshops on Google related technologies from international speakers. We called this first DevFest, the **DevFest Pisa 0.1**.

Today we are happy to _release_ the first stable version of our conference: **DevFest Pisa 2019!**

We want this DevFest to be an event organized **by the community, for the community**. We want to allow to everyone to be part of the DevFest Pisa organization, either as a speaker, as a volunteer or as a organizer. Stay tuned as details for participating to the DevFest will be coming soon.

But today you can already reserve your place taking your **free ticket**. The DevFest is happening in 4 months, but make sure you're not missing your seat:
